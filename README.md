I'm a freshman in college with a passion for **Open Source** and **Full-Stack Web Development**. I'm always on the lookout for ways to contribute to open source communities and projects, and I'm determined to become a skilled and influential developer.

I love learning new programming languages, frameworks, and tools to develop efficient and user-friendly full-stack web applications. I enjoy the challenge of problem-solving and have a keen eye for detail.

One thing that sets me apart is my enthusiasm for helping others. I believe that collaboration is key to success, and I'm always eager to share my knowledge and lend a hand to others in the tech community.

In my free time, I enjoy attending tech conferences, reading about technology, and experimenting with new projects. I believe that technology has the power to change the world for the better, and I'm excited to be a part of that change.

I'm confident that my passion, dedication, and willingness to learn will take me far in the world of tech. I can't wait to see what the future holds for me!
